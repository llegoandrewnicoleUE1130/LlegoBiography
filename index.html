<h2>Chasing Fun in Childhood</h2>
<hr size="5%" color="1b3652">    
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am Andrew Nicole D. Llego, born on November 30, 2001 in Metro Manila and grew up as the youngest with four older brothers.<sup>1</sup> A single mother Genela Llego, and a grandmother Zenadia Dajon were the people who worked hard to raise us.<sup>2</sup> My brothers from eldest to youngest, are Arvin, Arnold, Angelo, and Audrey.<sup>3</sup> As for my father, he left us when I was still a baby and has never made contact ever since.<sup>4</sup> Despite this, my family that is with me got along well.<sup>5</sup> While I myself do not have a very clear memory of my younger years; I was described as a very energetic child.<sup>6</sup> Always running around and had far too active an imagination and was curious about the things around me.<sup>7</sup> Even when I was as young as 5 years old, I was exposed to a lot of English media and that has led to me being quite fluent with the language even then.<sup>8</sup> Even my older brothers were the same in being fluent at an early age.<sup>10</sup> My mother believed that having this skill would be of great use for us in the future and for the most part, I agree.<sup>11</sup> Eventually, I managed to get into the public elementary school Center of Excellence (CENTEX).<sup>12</sup> CENTEX, while a public elementary school, is part of a program that is backed by the Ayala Foundation.<sup>13</sup> In that school, I was not one who would be called an exceptional student.<sup>14</sup> Most of my grades were middling, and I would take most of the blame there.<sup>15</sup> At that age, I was more concerned with having fun rather than focusing on my studies.<sup>16</sup> Most of those around me have described me during my childhood as someone bright but who does not apply themselves, and now that I am more grown-up, I agree.<sup>17</sup> Outside of school, despite some financial difficulties, my mother would take me and my brothers to other places for family bonding trips.<sup>18</sup> Sometimes it’s local like Luneta Park, and other times we go to our cousins in the province of Zambales and Kamarin.<sup>19</sup> Those memories of swimming in the beaches with my brothers and running around high up the hill are my most cherished childhood memories.<sup>20</sup> So, all in all, while my academic side is not something exceptional, I believe I had a very good childhood.<sup>21</sup></p>

<h2>Building Myself Up in Teenage Years</h2>
<hr size="5%" color="1b3652">
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For my high school years, initially, the plan was for me to enter into a private high school, but some problems arose.<sup>1</sup> Three of my eldest brothers were going through college, so it goes without saying that the financial burden that placed on my single mother was immense.<sup>2</sup> Combine that with my lackluster grades in my elementary school years where I could not secure a scholarship, and the decision to enter a public high school was obvious, at least from my perspective.<sup>3</sup> It was then in high school that I decided to really apply myself academically.<sup>4</sup> Focus more on studying so that I could get decent grades and start establishing a better career in the future.<sup>5</sup> At the start, there were some adjustments that needed to be made since I was going from an Ayala-backed school into a public high school.<sup>6</sup> There were a lot more people, it was a lot noisier, and the school schedule was less streamlined than I was used to.<sup>7</sup> Despite those minor problems, I enjoyed it quite a lot.<sup>8</sup> Even though I doubted people around me at the time when they said I had a good mind but didn't apply it, seeing the progress I made academically in high school when I decided to focus was an eye-opener.<sup>9</sup> In the first year, my grades shot up from an average of 85 in elementary to consistent 90s and up.<sup>10</sup> In the first year, I was in Section 3, and by the time I was in the second year, I jumped up to Section 1.<sup>11</sup> In the second year, I also met friends that would stick by me all throughout junior high.<sup>12</sup> It was a confidence boost to me, and being praised for it made me want to try harder.<sup>13</sup> I was riding this high point all the way to third year of junior high, and it felt as though everything was going to be all right.<sup>14</sup> Unfortunately, it was in fourth year that my grandmother started showing obvious signs of Alzheimer's.<sup>15</sup> It started out small, like forgetting where she placed things and what date it was.<sup>16</sup> We thought it was just part of her getting old, so it wasn’t something we needed to get alarmed by.<sup>17</sup> As I entered fourth year, I had a clear goal in mind for what I wanted to be when I got into college; I wanted to be an accountant like my mother.<sup>18</sup> I applied for Senior High at the University of The East and got into the ABM program.<sup>19</sup> My academics were still on the good side, and with two of my brothers graduating in college, our financial burdens were becoming lighter.<sup>20</sup> Things were going to plan, but unfortunately, a global pandemic decided to throw things into chaos.<sup>21</sup></p>

    
<h2>When At The Lowest Point, All You Can Do Is Go Up</h2>
<hr size="5%" color="1b3652">
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I graduated Senior High with honors and got into the college I wanted; University of Santo Tomas.<sup>1</sup> I had to attend most of my classes online at home due to the pandemic that was spreading across the globe.<sup>2</sup> This new online environment didn’t quite sit well with me, and adjusting to it was a lot more difficult than expected.<sup>3</sup> My grades took a small dip, but I thought it was still manageable, but things were about to get worse.<sup>4</sup> My grandmother's Alzheimer's started getting worse, and with me being at home with her, I had to pull double duty as a caretaker and doing online school.<sup>5</sup> Our finances may have gotten better, but that doesn’t mean all the debts my mother incurred to put my brothers through college were wiped away as well, so we couldn’t hire a 24/7 caretaker.<sup>6</sup> This took a lot out of my mental health with worrying over my grandmother, adjusting to a new online platform, and the global pandemic made me unable to properly focus on my studies.<sup>7</sup> When Second Year College came around and I saw my grades, I knew I couldn’t continue on my dream of becoming an accountant.<sup>8</sup> I decided to take a year off college and focus on taking care of my grandmother so that she could at least have a comfortable end.<sup>9</sup> It wasn’t always pleasant since she often forgot where she was, who I was, and she had an obsession with money that wasn’t there anymore.<sup>10</sup> There were times when care for her got extremely difficult when she refused to sleep, got irrationally mad, hallucinated things that didn’t happen, or wouldn’t drink her medicines, but I pushed through with my family.<sup>11</sup> My eldest brother started earning quite a lot of money, and so during those last years of my grandmother, we went on trips once more.<sup>12</sup> We went to the beach, the province, and all sorts of places so that she wouldn't be cooped up at home doing nothing but forgetting, and my grandmother even managed to attend my eldest brother's wedding.<sup>13</sup> I like to think she was happy in those final years.<sup>14</sup> My grandmother finally died on April 4, 2023.<sup>15</sup> After her death, I took a hard look into my life and decided to change course.<sup>16</sup> With my interest in working with computers rising during the pandemic years, I applied for BSIT at the suggestion of my brothers and mother and went back into the familiar University of the East.<sup>17</sup> At the low point of my life, most of my confidence I had built up during my high school years really took a toll, but after just one year into Programming, I find that I quite like it a lot.<sup>18</sup> My grades started going back up and I feel like I’m enjoying the lessons more than when I was in accounting.<sup>19</sup> And now at the time of writing this, I am halfway through my sophomore year, in good health, and excited to finish school.<sup>20</sup></p>
